What are Ciphers?

Ciphers are algorithms or processes used to convert plaintext into ciphertext, effectively obscuring the original message. They employ keys to facilitate reverse transformation, ensuring that only authorized parties can interpret the data securely.

Purpose of Studying Ciphers

The primary motivation for studying ciphers lies in safeguarding information against potential threats. By understanding these cryptographic techniques, we can develop more robust defenses against malicious attacks and enhance overall data protection strategies.


Goals of the project 

This project aims to analyze different cipher types, their effectiveness, and applicability in real-world scenarios. Additionally, we endeavor to develop insights and methodologies to improve encryption practices within various sectors.


Expected outcomes

Anticipated results include a comprehensive understanding of modern ciphers, practical applications, and the identification of emerging trends in data security. We aim to contribute valuable knowledge that will influence future practices in encryption technology.
